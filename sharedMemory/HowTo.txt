Now you can see three files:
1. processOne.c
2. processTwo.c
3. shmDelete.c

At first call processOne
gcc -o One processOne.c
./One

Open another console and run "ipcs"
Now u should see anything in the shared Memory section

This opens the sharedMemory and writes the alphabet in it.
The sharedMemory is still open even the process closed.

Thats what we want to proof with processTwo
gcc -o One processTwo.c
./Two

This process reads the letters we wrote into the SHM with processOne
The process is closing and is detaching the SHM at the end.

Now we need to delete it because its still existing what u can proof with "ipcs"
Run the shmDelete.c
gcc -o delete shmDelete.c
./delete

Run ipcs again and you see.
NOTHING
TADAAAA!

Nice work ;) Thumb up
